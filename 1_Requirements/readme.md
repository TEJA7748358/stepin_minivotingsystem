 # INTRODUCTION:
	
   Now-a -days everything has become easy and smart to do work. In past years during elections, the admins were having the list of voters who would elect and vote to respective nomine. 
 At this case there might be a misuse of votes by providing fake details or by voting many times on single voter ID. 
 In order to over come these I have choosen this project named MINI VOTING SYSTEM. In this project every voter would get registered prior to the election. 
 Based on the number of registrations admin records the data and stores at database.At the time of elections these registered user is provided with username and password (login credentials). 
 User has to logon to official voting website, soon after he/she would see the nominated people whom he/she like to vote. Then he/she can click on the nominated names and need to submit his voting. 
 This will make easy to vote rather than standing on line and voting physically. There is no chance for malpractices and even this information is highly secured and safe.

# RESEARCH:
 
   When this thought hits I started reffering internet and going through many modules which really helps my project to build. I have gone through a physical voting system and finger print voting system then I worked on Mini Voting System. I came to learn new things while doing this projects. I reffered IEEE papers to do this project. All the modules are arranged based on the requirements like voting credentials and systems effeciency and cloud competency. Comparing to other voting system this would be more easiest way to vote and more secure too. 
   
# COST AND FEATURES AND TIMELINE:
## COST:
  This project needs less cost to implement. So this adds more advantage to project in implementation.
## FEATURES:
  1. People can vote through online with the given credentials.
  2. Time saving and need not to wait long time to vote.
  3. Portable so that we can cast our vote from anywhere.
  4. Very secured.
  5. Data of each vote can be recorded and stored in cloud this is done for future refference.
  6. No crosstalks allowed.
  7. At the time of casting end-to-end encryption takes place.
## TIMELINE:
  Timeline generally refers that how exactly the time taken for process of work. Here is the attachment shown that how well the process is taken place.

# DEFINING OUR SYSTEM:
  
  Initially every person who is having right to vote and are eligible to vote can register thier name in the official website. And can generate thier username and password immediately. Using this credentials the one can logon to the website where he/she csupposed to cast thier vote to the nominated people. At the time of election, soon after the logging on to website they can see the nominated people, nomine symboll, flag and details along with the cast option. The user can click on the option "CAST" and can vote to that perticular person. Every user is having two options so that they can give thier vote to two nomines. The counting is done at the time of casting and each nomine count is increased by each casting. So at this case user can submit their options with the provided submit button. This system is very relieable and portable. This system stores the data 
  and each record is been saved in cloud. This information can be accessed by the admin and can also be used for the future use. This cloud data can be reffered for any external use during count.

# SWOT ANALYSIS:
## STRENGTHS: 
  1. Rapid voting count and no regulation.
  2. Accuracy of results.
  3. Redundancy at human intervention.
  4. Can vote anywhere i.e., portable.
  5. Saves time of counting.
## WEAKNESS:
  1. Lack of transparent policy.
  2. Infrastructure and environmental.
  3. Very sensitive.
  4. Gap in experience, knowledge for non experts.
  5. Needs high data.
  6. Difficult incase of lack of signal.
## OPPORTUNITIES:
  1. Increased convenience for voters.
  2. More focused at technology and innovation.
  3. No shipping costs for clients/voters.
  4. No delay in sending out material and receive back.
## THREATS:
  1. Privilege escalation by insiders.
  2. Security Requirements for protection are at transport, storage.
  3. Possibility of fraud through manipulation by small group of insiders.

# 4W'S AND 1'H:
## WHO:
  1. General people can cast the vote through voting system during elections.
  2. Students at the time of polls in their college. 
  3. At organisations for online poll submissions. 
  4. For counting the majority in elections.
## WHAT:
  1. It casts the vote of every general and keeps the counting of each record and saves the data which is submitted.
  2. Makes results easy to declare based on count.
  
# HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS: 
  1. Userâ€™s login credentials.
User should caste the vote.
Records should be saved in a database in the form of a file.
Data should not be lost in case of failure Scenario.
Admin could access the website.
# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
Data should always be stored before closing the system.
User shall be able to work on previous data.
